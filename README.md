# curio-http

A high-level HTTP client powered by [curio](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio).

# Important Disclaimer

Both curio-http and curio itself are experimental software that only work on POSIX systems (OS X, Linux, etc.).

There are a lot of features missing from curio-http right now, which I'll be adding as time permits.

# Installation

Clone this repo and then run `python setup.py develop`.

# Usage

Check out this [tutorial](http://scribu.net/blog/asynchronous-http-requests-in-python-3.5.html).
